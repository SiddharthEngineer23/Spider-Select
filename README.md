# Spider-Select
Chrome extension which tracks user actions.

This chrome extension will return a list of user actions (on a static webpage) using the CSS values of any number of clicks. It was independently designed during the 2020 Hack OH-I/O hackathon, utilizing the already existing SelectorGadget codebase. The goal of the project is to combine this extension with a JS webpage which can execute the same series of user clicks (further customizeable) using a JS web bot API.
